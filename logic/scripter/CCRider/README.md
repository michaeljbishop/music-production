# How to install CCRider:

1. Add a "Scripter" midi insert to your instrument. It should show you the control panel.
2. Press the "Open Script in Editor" button if the "Script Editor" is not showing.
3. Copy and paste all of this source code into the editor and press "Run Script"
4. The Scripter plugin interface should now show a number of controls.


# How to use the Scripter plugin interface:

1. Press the "Toggle Configuration" button. This will show you all the parameters
of the plugin including some you are not likely to change that often.

Use the "Input (CC)" and "<name> (CC)" parameters to specify which CC value it should
read, and which CC values it should write to. Press the "Toggle Configuration"
button again to turn off all the extra controls.

2. Open your virtual-instrument's control panel if you want to see the controls
in real-time.

3. Move your slider that controls the CC input parameter. You should hear
the effect as you play your instrument and should see it in real-time on the
virtual instrument's control panel.

4. Leave your control slider at 50%. In the Scripter Plugin interface, start
configuring the curve sliders. You should see in real-time, in your virtual-
instrument interface, how it affects the output CC values and what a 50% value
means to the outputs.

5. Experiment by playing your instrument and play with the curves until you
reach a configuration that feels natural to hear and play.
